        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          Sarasota Computer Solutions was founded with one goal in mind: to provide 
          <strong>affordable, reliable, and family-friendly IT services</strong> for our community. 
          We believe technology should empower people — not frustrate them. That’s why we combine 
          professional expertise with a personal, approachable style of support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our owner, <strong>Darien Entwistle</strong>, brings over a decade of hands-on experience in 
          <strong>network engineering, systems administration, and cybersecurity</strong>. 
          Having worked in fast-paced IT environments and Managed Service Providers (MSPs), Darien 
          understands the unique needs of both <strong>residential users</strong> and 
          <strong>small businesses with 50 employees or fewer</strong>.
